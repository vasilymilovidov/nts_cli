A simple cli app to play NTS Radio live stations and mixtapes. It needs 'ffmpeg' to be installed on your system. It also needs [Vibra](https://github.com/BayernMuller/vibra) for its song recognition feature. Recognised songs are logged to a file called 'nts_cli_song_history.txt' in your home folder.
